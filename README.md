## üé® Overview

The Booru Prompt Builder is a sleek, modern web application that streamlines the entire process of crafting rich, detailed prompts for AI-generated images. Whether you're an established digital artist seeking efficiency or a newcomer aiming to explore endless AI art possibilities, this tool helps you quickly generate high-quality prompts for NovelAI or Stable Diffusion.

## ‚ú® Features

### Character-Centric Interface
- **Add & Manage Characters**: Effortlessly set up to four different characters with gender toggles, optional enhancers, and the ability to import from a pre-built database of popular figures from games, anime, and other media.
- **Fuzzy Search & Auto-Fill**: Integrated Fuse.js fuzzy search helps you find and auto-fill characters by name or series with minimal typing.

### Dynamic Action Assignments
- **Source/Target/Mutual Actions**: Assign actions between characters (e.g., "hugging," "fighting") to bring your scene to life. Pick a "source" character performing an action on a "target," or set both characters into a mutual action.

### Artist Repository & Scene Selection
- **Artist Cards**: Add up to four artists (or define your own custom artist style) to shape the aesthetics of your generated piece.
- **Scene Cards**: Pick a setting from the curated list or define a completely custom environment.

### Robust Randomization
- **Random Characters**: Instantly generate one or more random characters from the existing database.
- **Full Random Prompt**: Build an entire prompt with a single click‚Äîrandomizing characters, scenes, artists, and interactions.

### Unified Prompt Output
- **Preview & Copy**: The tool compiles everything into a well-structured prompt with color-coded or plain text form.
- **Collapsible & Editable**: Expand or collapse the preview area, and edit the output text directly before copying.

### Sleek, Modern UI
- **Draggable Cards**: Use intuitive drag handles to re-order character blocks and artist/scene cards.
- **Responsive & Clear**: Crisp, navigable interface with an appealing dark mode-inspired aesthetic.
