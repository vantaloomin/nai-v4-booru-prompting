// fuzzySearch.js
// Implementation using Fuse.js for advanced fuzzy searching, including transpositions.

//
// 1) createFuse(candidates)
//
//    - Accepts an array of candidate objects. Each candidate should have at least
//      { name, title, display } so that Fuse can search them.
//    - Configures Fuse with typical fuzzy-friendly settings (ignore location, a modest threshold, etc.).
//    - Returns a Fuse instance.
//
// 2) fuseSearch(query, fuseInstance)
//
//    - If query is empty, returns an empty array.
//    - Otherwise, performs fuseInstance.search(query).
//    - Returns an array of matched candidate objects in best-match order (Fuse sorts by relevance).

 * Initializes a Fuse instance for fuzzy searching your candidate list.
 * Each candidate is assumed to have keys: "name", "title", and "display" (or whichever you prefer).
